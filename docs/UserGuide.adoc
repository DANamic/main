Thank you for your interest in the *NUS Module Planner* and welcome to the *User Guide*!

== Introduction

The *NUS Module Planner* (_NUSModPlnr_) is for Computer Science (CS) students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their enrollments in NUS modules over their school life. **With NUSModPlnr, module planning has never been easier!**

When starting up the application, you will be able to see the *Home Screen* (_Figure 1. below_).

.Home Screen View

Do you want to keep track of the modules you will be taking over multiple semesters? Do you want to easily create multiple plans of these multiple semesters?

Are you frustrated about managing the numerous details of the graduation requirements for a CS degree? NUSModPlnr allows you to check which graduation requirements you can satisfy, on the fly.

Do you want to keep track of your grades to better decide on which modules to enrol in? NUSModPlnr provides a simple way to calculate grade statistics.

If you can type fast, NUSModPlnr can help you plan your modules in a fast, yet intuitive way. NUSModPlnr is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The following commands below are part of the application's *Grade Management*, which allow you to manage and view your grades to see modules affected in your academic plan.

[TIP]
The same module can be added into multiple timetables of the same student. Therefore, each enrollment (one per semester) of the same module can have a separate grade. +
For example, it is possible for you to enroll in the module `CS2040` during `year/1 sem/1` and then `year/1 sem/2`. +
You may refer to <<timetable-management,*Timetable Management*>> to see how you can use timetables.

==== Managing a module's grade: `module grade`

You can use this command to manage the grades of your modules. The following variants of the command can view and set the grade of the module you specify.

[NOTE]
This command and its variants require a timetable to be selected (using the <<timetable-active-command,`timetable active`>> command).

===== Viewing a module's grade

You can use this command to display the <<grade-management,grade>> of the specified module.

[NOTE]
This command only shows the grade of the specified module in your currently selected timetable. +
You can use the <<student-grade-command,`student grade`>> command to view the grades of all modules together.

Format: `module grade MODULE_CODE`

Example:

* `module grade CS2040`

===== Setting a module's grade

You can use this command to set the <<grade-management,grade>> of the specified module. +
The modules which you set the grades of using this command will be counted towards your academic performance (see the <<student-grade-command,`student grade`>> command).

[NOTE]
This command only modifies the grade of the module in the selected timetable. Other enrollments with the same module code in different semesters will not be affected.

Format: `module grade MODULE_CODE grade/GRADE`

Example:

* `module grade CS2040 grade/A`

===== Exercising the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option for a module

You can declare that you have chosen to exercise the <<su,Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory>> for a module using the following variant of this command. +
The modules which you set the grades of using this command are not counted towards your academic performance (see the <<student-grade-command,`student grade`>> command). However, grade you specify will still be recorded.

[NOTE]
This command only modifies the grade of the module in the selected timetable. Other enrollments with the same module code in different semesters will not be affected.

Format: `module grade MODULE_CODE su/GRADE`

Example:

* `module grade IS1103 su/F`

[[student-grade-command]]
==== Viewing a student's grade: `student grade`

You can use this command to display the <<cap,Cumulative Average Point>> of the selected student (see the <<student-active-command,`student active`>> command). +
Other statistics such as the number of modules declared as <<su,Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory>> are also shown. +
You may also see a list of modules taken and their grades.

[NOTE]
This command requires a student to be selected (using the <<student-active-command,`student active`>> command).
[TIP]
Use the <<module-grade-command,`module grade`>> command to set the grade of modules in the currently selected timetable of a student.
[TIP]
The same module can be added into multiple timetables of the same student. Refer to <<timetable-management,*Timetable Management*>> to see how you can use timetables.
[TIP]
Use this command to be informed of your academic progress and to plan ahead for difficult modules.


Format: `student grade`

Example:

// end::sharingdatafiles[]

// tag::faq[]

// tag::proposed-future-enhancements[]

=== Proposed Future Enhancements

_(Benjamin wrote this section on "Proposed Future Enhancements" below.)_

NUS Module Planner has a lot more potential to grow!

Below are some of the other great features we think can be implemented in v2.0 onward:

* *Module Viewer with Search* - Other than just searching for modules, search for their content instead, such as modules that deal with _Heat Transfer_ or _Geology_.
* *Timetable Planner with Friends* - Instead of just viewing timetables of different students (_i.e. friends_) separately, be able to overlay them in one _"Timetable View"_, for easier group planning.
* *Requirements Double-Upper* - Instead of just one `Major`, handle double `Major` programme students, or even those with Minors.
* *Module Popularity Prediction* - Get and analyse historic data from NUSMods about module uptake, so that students do not have to plan for modules that would be overly subscribed.
* *Support for Overseas Exchange and University Town College Programmes* - Be able to plan for special modules only offered in these programmes, if a student is enrolled in them.
* *Live Module Data* - Get the latest Module Data available from NUS Mods and plan your Semester before it starts.
* *Module Data History* - View historical data on Module enrollments and decide if when you want to take a certain `Module`.

// end::proposed-future-enhancements[]

== FAQ

_(Hak Wee populated this section on "FAQ" below.)_

This provides a list of *Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)* that you may have.

=== General Questions

*Q*: Do I need any particular system requirements to run this application? +
*A*: Our application is designed to work on most major operating systems (i.e. Windows, macOS and Linux) and is lightweight, as long as you have Java 11 installed.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NUSModPlnr folder.

=== Feature Specific Questions

*Q*: Who can I add as students? +
*A*: You can add yourself to track your degree progression, or add your friends as well, if you would like to sync your academic plan together.

*Q*: Why are there letters beside the lesson number in the calendar? +
*A*: NUS assigns letter codes to each lesson type for their internal management. Nonetheless, you only need to type the lesson number when managing your lessons.

*Q*: Why are the lessons not shifted for each respective timetable? +
*A*: Lessons are tagged to the `Active Student`, to allow you to see historical data on all lessons you have taken in previous semesters.
