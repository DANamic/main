== Before You Begin

Welcome to the *Developer Guide* for the NUS Module Planner! Unlike the *User Guide* that has been ordered in the flow for a user, this guide has been ordered lexicographically (specifically for _Implementation_) to assist you in finding the features and their implementations faster.

[TIP]
As usual, if you have questions, feature suggestions or bugs to report, feel free to open an issue in our *Issue Tracker* on GitHub!

== Setting Up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

// tag::design-architecture[]

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

[.text-center]
.Architecture Diagram

image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `student remove 1`.

.Component interactions for `student remove 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// end::design-architecture[]

// tag::ui[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CalendarBox`, `CommandBox`, `GradWindow`, `ModuleCard`, `ModuleListPanel`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

// end::ui[]

// tag::design-logic[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `PlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("student remove 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `student remove 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `StudentRemoveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// end::design-storage[]

// tag::design-common[]
[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.planner.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes our implementation and design decision details of the features in the NUS Module Planner. As a reminder, they have been ordered laconically for easier search and reference.

// tag::calendar-implementation[]

[[Implementation-Calendar]]
=== Calendar View

The application has a *"Calendar Schedule"* window implemented to allow students to see their timetable and lesson schedules. Once a lesson has been added, will they be visible in this window upon launch by the `Launch Calendar` button.

==== Calendar UI Implementation

There are two ways to view the Calendar. You can click on the launch calendar to see the lessons that you have added. Another way is to click on the semester button in the module description page to see the lessons available.

The Calendar builds its UI based on this implemented components:

* *Show Calendar* `setCalendar(List<Lesson> lessons)`

_We will add more about how we implemented this further, and the design decisions made._

.Activity Diagram for launching Calendar
image::CalendarActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]

The Calendar populates each of the Label in the grid pane based on the list of `Lesson` provided by the planner.

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (Current implementation):* To build the table using scene builder with each labels being shaded to show the time
** Pros: Every single UI component of the calendar is customizable, allowing for further modifications.
** Cons: Tedious and duplicated code for each Label to be set a value.

* *Alternative 2:* Use another library jfxtras which has an i calendar API
** Pros: Reduce the amount of work needed to create the component
** Cons: Comes with bugs that scene builder is unable to support

// end::calendar-implementation[]

[[Implementation-Grade]]
=== Grade Management
(Vincent wrote the section "Grade Management" below)

The *Grade Management* feature allows users to record and keep track of their grades in their academic plan,
helping them to make better academic plans.

The *Grade Management* feature is made of two parts:

* *Module Grade Management*: `module grade`
* *Student Grade Display*:  `student grade`

==== Module Grade Management

The *Module Grade Management* allows users to record their grades.

===== Grade Representation

Each enrollment in each timetable of a student stores a module grade. The module grade can be pending, have the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option exercised, or be graded. +
More specifically:

Each `Student` stores `Enrollment` objects in each value (of type `TimeTable`) of its `timeTableMap : TimeTableMap`.
Each `Enrollment` is then 1-1 associated to exactly one `credit : Optional<Grade>`.

When `credit` is equal to `Optional.<Grade>empty()`, the enrollment is considered to have a pending module grade.
When `credit.isPresent()` is true, then the `Grade` stored within can be interpreted as follows:

`Grade` objects are immutable, and its fields therefore can have `public` access modifiers and are `final`. Suppose there is a `grade : Grade` object.
The `grade.letterGrade : LetterGrade` represents the letter grade received for an enrollment, which can be one of:  +
`A+`, `A`, `A-`, `B+`, `B`, `B-`, `C+`, `C-`, `D+`, `D`, `F`, `CS`, `CU`, `W` or `EXE`.

The `grade.isSu : boolean` represents whether the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option was exercised for the grade.
For example, a student could choose to exercise the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option for a grade of "B+". +
This is distinct from the `grade.letterGrade.isSu : boolean`, which determines if the letter grade itself is ungraded.
This occurs for module grades such as "CS" and "CU". +
When at least one of `grade.isSu` or `grade.letterGrade.isSu` is true, the `Grade` object does not count towards academic performance.

The semantics of the `Optional<Grade>` object in an `Enrollment` can be summarised in the activity diagram below.

//TODO: ADD DIAGRAM
.Activity Diagram of Grade Representation
image::GradeRepresentationActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]


===== Module Grade Commands

The user views and sets grades of enrollments with a single command `"module grade"`. Parsing of the command is handled by `ModuleGradeCommandParser`.

The `ModuleGradeCommandParser` parses the command string (e.g. `"CS2040 grade/A"`) into the preamble which contains the module code, and the arguments which contains the grade. +
Then it returns a subclass of `ModuleGradeCommand` (itself a subclass of `ModuleCommand`) which is declared abstract. +
Its concrete subclasses are `ModuleGradeViewCommand`, `ModuleGradeSetCommand` and `ModuleGradeResetCommand`.
Refer to <<Backend-SubCmd, Sub-Commands>> to see how the `ModuleGradeCommandParser` is invoked by `ModuleCommandParser`.

. To view a grade, the user uses the command format `"module grade MODULE_CODE"`. This will generate a `ModuleGradeViewCommand` object.
. To set a grade, there are two options. Both generate a `ModuleGradeSetCommand` object.
.. To set a grade counted towards academic performance, the user uses the command format `"module grade MODULE_CODE grade/GRADE"`.
.. To exercise the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option, the user uses the command format `"module grade MODULE_CODE su/GRADE"`.
. To reset a grade, the user uses the command format `"module grade MODULE_CODE grade/"`. This will generate a `ModuleGradeResetCommand` object.
[none]

If both `module/GRADE` and `su/GRADE` parameters are supplied, the `ModuleGradeCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`

The `ModuleGrade*Command#execute(Model)` methods of the command objects generated then use `Model#getModuleGrade(ModuleCode)` and `Model#setModuleGrade(ModuleCode)` to get and set the enrollment's grade, respectively.

The following class diagram summarises the associations of classes involved in the `"module grade"` command.

//TODO: ADD DIAGRAM
.Class Diagram of `module grade` classes
image::ModuleGradeCommandClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

==== Student Grade Display

The user may also view the cumulative grades of the selected `Student` using the `"student grade"` command. +
The `StudentCommandParser` directly creates a `StudentGradeCommand` object (a subclass of `StudentCommand`), and all preamble and arguments are ignored.

`StudentGradeCommand#execute(Model)` then loops through all `StudentSemester` the selected student has using `Model#getStudentSemesters()`,
which returns the `StudentSemester` in chronological order (as defined in `StudentSemester#compareTo()`).
This ordering is more convenient to the user compared to the arbitrary ordering of internal to `TimeTableMap`.

Using `Student#getTimeTable(StudentSemester) : TimeTable` and `TimeTable#getEnrollments() : UniqueEnrollmentList`, each enrollment of each timetable is iterated in order.
Then `Enrollment#getGrade() : Optional<Grade>` is used to get the grade (pending, or S/U option exercised, or graded).
Since `Grade#toString()` is overloaded, `StudentGradeCommand` only needs to handle the case where the `Optional<Grade>` is empty.

The result text is accumulated to form a listing of modules taken and their grades.

During iteration, a `CumulativeGrade` accumulator object is also used to tally up statistics related to the grades of the enrollments.
`CumulativeGrade` handles the number of credits taken for graded, S/U-exercised and all `Grade` objects supplied. +
`StudentGradeCommand` invokes the `CumulativeGrade#accumulate(Grade grade, int credits)` method, which handles all the logic necessary to correctly accumulate grade statistics.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Syntax of `"module grade"` command
* *Alternative 1: (current choice)* Use a single command with `grade/` and `su/` prefixes which are mutually exclusive
** Pros: Only a single command is needed to handle both graded and S/U-exercised grades. Resetting an enrollment's grade is also easy by allowing the user to specify an empty `grade/` argument.
** Cons: The syntax might be confusing to the user, and there is the edge case of both `grade/` and `su/` being supplied, which must be handled.

* *Alternative 2:* Use separate sub-commands for setting, resetting and exercising the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option.
** Pros: The syntax is simpler for the user because there is only one format for each command.
** Cons: Further commands have to be implemented, which causes code duplication.

===== Aspect: Representation of enrollment grades
* *Alternative 1: (current choice)* Use an `Optional<Grade>` which stores a `LetterGrade` and `isSu : boolean`
** Pros: Clearly distinguishes between a pending grade, a grade with Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option exercised, and a grade which is counted towards academic performance. +
Serialisation also directly corresponds to `null` for a pending grade.
** Cons: Handling the case where the grade is pending is not convenient for iteration.

* *Alternative 2:* Use `Grade` to store whether the the grade is pending
** Pros: More convenient to use for developers.
** Cons: Serialisation is more complex, and more complex code is needed to handle pending grades in the implementation of `Grade`.

// tag::feature-graduation-requirement[]
[[Implementation-GradReq]]
=== Graduation Requirements Features

The *Graduation Requirements* feature is what allows students to ensure that their academic plan and corresponding modules are assisting them towards fulfilling their own criteria to graduate.

==== Degree Management

The Graduation Requirements are made up of 2 implemented components:

* *Declaration of Major:* `major set`
* *Declaration of Specialisation:* `specialisation set`

The `Major` and `Specialisation` entities are automatically created and populated through the JSON data received from NUSMods. Furthermore, `Student` entities can only be associated in a _1-0..1_ relationship with a `Specialisation` entity.

The following high-level sequence diagrams illustrates the interactions between the `Ui`, `Logic` & `Model` components when either a *Major* or *Specialisation* is being set:

.Sequence Diagram for `Major` being set, with respect to `MainWindow` from `Ui`, `Logic` & `Model`
image::sequenceDiagramMajorSetLogicModelStorage.png[align="center"]

.Sequence Diagram for `Major` being set with respect to the `MajorSetCommand`
image::sequenceDiagramMajorSet.png[align="center"]

.Sequence Diagram for `Specialisation` being set (e.g. `AlgorithmsAndTheorySpecialisation`) with regards to `SpecialisationSetCommand`
image::sequenceDiagramSpecialisationSet.png[align="center"]

==== Verification of Graduation Requirement Fulfilment

Once the *Major* and *Specialisation* (if any), or a *Student* is set, the following logic is used to verify if the `Student` 's `GraduationRequirements` are being met, based on the list of `Module` which which the `Student` has enrolled in:

. Retrieval of the main base of the `GraduationRequirement` based on the `Major` and ultimately `DegreeProgram` of the `Student`.
. Retrieval of the list of `Module` which the `Student` has enrolled in.
. Passing in of the list of enrolled `Module` into each `GraduationRequirement` and determining if the `GraduationRequirement` has been met.
.. The modelling of the actual *Graduation Requirements* of NUS CS and IS undergraduate students are accomplished by making use of the various implementations of `GraduationRequirement` such as
... `CompoundGraduationRequirement` for groups of `Module` s which a `Student` is allowed to choose from, with certain conditions for fulfilment such as:
.... Minimum number of Modules
.... Minimum number of Module Credits
.... Minimum number of Modules that must be 4000-level or above
... `SpecialisationGraduationRequirement` for _"Specialisations" or "Tracks"_ depending on the terminology of the respective faculty that the `Major` belongs to).
... `WildcardGraduationRequirement` for Requirements that need to be fulfilled from a fixed pool of `Module` s which have `ModuleCode` s starting with certain characters (_e.g. GEH, GES, GET_)
. Thereafter, the corresponding `Module` entities that have been added will be verified against the compiled `Graduation Requirements`.
. Finally, requirements that are met, are checked or crossed accordingly - which is displayed in the left-panel of the GUI.

The flow of how the `Graduation Requirements` is put together with information from `Major` and `Specialisation` can be found in the below class diagram:

.Extended Class Diagram of Graduation Requirements Implementation
image::GraduationRequirementsCD-expanded.png[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):* Model real life graduation requirements in an OOP-manner with a different class for different types of requirements containing different logic determining the fulfilment of the graduation requirement, each inheriting from a base class to allow for polymorphism.
** Pros: Well Structured and separates actual requirements from the model by creating classes that provide the logic needed for fulfilment calculation.
** Cons: Each Programme will have to construct it's own combination of the various implementations `GraduationRequirement` to model actual graduation requirements.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement each `DegreeProgram` 's graduation requirement as a class on it's own.
** Pros: Each `DegreeProgram` can have the flexibility of customising fulfilment logic.
** Cons: Duplicate codes due to many classes may have the same fulfilment logic, but different data.
// end::feature-graduation-requirement[]

// tag::lessons-implementation[]

[[Implementation-Lesson]]
=== Lesson Features

The *Lesson Feature* allows students to manage the their respective lessons for the academic planning. When managing lessons, they are rendered in a *Lesson View Screen* in the GUI.

==== Lesson Implementation

The `Lesson` entities are automatically created and populated through the JSON data received from NUSMods. Furthermore, `Lesson` entities are coupled to `Module` entities in a _*..1_ relationship.

This coupling allows us to detect if a student tries to add duplicate `Lesson` entities and perform error handling or alternative advisement, where possible.

.Class Diagram of `Lesson` Implementation
image::LessonClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The attributes of the `Lesson` class are retrieved from the serialised JSON file.

This implementation consist of 3 commands.

* `LessonAdd` - Finds the lessons from the module and add it into the list of lessons for the active student.
* `LessonList` - List down the lessons for the active student.
* `LessonRemove` - Remove the lessons from the active student based on the provided index.

===== Adding of Lesson
The `LessonAddCommandParser` method is called and it will get the `ModuleCode` and `Semester` provided by the arguments. It will run the `LessonDataImporterUtil` class run method to convert the json file to `Lesson` Object. This is then added to the active student on the planner.

===== Listing of Lesson
The `LessonListCommand` method is called and it will iterate through the list of `Lesson` that is associated with the active student in the planner.

===== Deleting of Lesson
The `LessonRemoveCommandParser` method is called and it will get the `Index` provided by the arguments. It will retrieve the list of `Lesson` and delete the object based on the index given.


==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):* Letting the users decide the lesson they want.
** Pros: Allows for flexibility as it can reuse some of the code written for modules to adapt for lessons.
** Cons: More checks are needed to ensure user do not key in invalid values

* *Alternative 2:* Hard code to take the first option of each lesson.
** Pros: Easier logic for the developer. Less bugs to deal with.
** Cons: Inconvenient for the user and does not allow the flexibility to choose the lesson that they want to take.

// end::lessons-implementation[]

[[Implementation-Module]]
=== Module Features & Database

Bulk of the sections (of <<Implementation>>) and features throughout, require heavy interaction with the `Module` entities. *Modules* form the majority of what students will need to interact with, as these are the classes they must take and clear, in order to graduate.

==== Module Implementation

The `Module` entities are automatically created and populated through the JSON data received from NUSMods. The following class diagram below shows all the values that the `Module` entity stores or is associated with:

.Class Diagram of `Module` Implementation
image::ModuleClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The attributes of the `Module` class are retrieved from the serialised JSON file.

Additionally, `Module` entities can be marked as `exempted` which allow Students to declare in the application, that will get the module credits associated, without having to declare taking it or associate a `Grade`.

// tag::search-implementation[]

[[Implementation-Module-Search]]
==== Module Search

On First Launch, all the modules that are available in NUS (in accordance to NUSMods data) is populated into the *Module Panel Screen*. This allows a student to select modules and view the corresponding module descriptions and details.

Students are able utilise the _"Search Bar"_ to search for any module based on the `module code` or `module name`. When given the query with the corresponding values, the following logic takes place:

.Sequence Diagram for Module Search
image::searchSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

If any results match the query enetered, they are populated into the *Search Screen* GUI for the user.

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):* Using streams to collect the modules and search
** Pros: Less mutability as the modules will not be accidentally modified.
** Cons: Hard to debug when there is a bug.

* *Alternative 2:* Loop and search each modules.
** Pros: Lightweight using a for loop.
** Cons: Modules may be accidentally modified if it is not protected properly.

// end::search-implementation[]

[[Implementation-PlannerModel]]
=== Planner Model
(Vincent wrote this section "Planner Model" below)

The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/model/Planner.java[`Planner`] class stores information about the App's state.

Many operations of the `Planner` must be inherently stateful because user operations include selecting students and timetables,
which are then also known as the 'active student' and 'active timetable', respectively.
These selection operations affect which students and timetables future operations use.
The App needs access to the list of students, the selected student, and the selected timetable of the selected student need to be stored.

As described in *Student Model* (in <<Design-Model,*Model Component*>>), the `Student` stores information related to the timetables it has, which stores the enrollments for each timetable. The `Planner` only needs to retain indices/keys to the active student and semester.

Therefore, `Planner` stores information including:

* `UniqueStudentList : students`, which is the list of students in the planner. +
Uniqueness (using `Student#isSameStudent`) of the students is enforced. This prevents two students from having the same name.
* `int : activeStudentIndex`, an index for the currently selected `Student`. +
This index refers to a valid student exactly when the index is within the bounds of the `students` list. +
Therefore, no student is selected if the index is out of bounds of the `students` list.
* `StudentSemester : activeSemester`, which corresponds to the currently selected `TimeTable` for the currently selected `Student`.
This is `null` when there is no active timetable selected. +
The `Planner` must have a valid `Student` selected in order to have a non-null `activeSemester`, which is an invariant enforced by `Planner#getActiveTimeTable()`

All of these fields have the `protected` access modifier to hide and encapsulate the data. To access this data, the following methods are used by the `Model`:

* `Student getActiveStudent()` to get the active `Student`. +
Note that the active `Student` is not stored directly, but with an index `activeStudentIndex` as previously mentioned.
* `Student getActiveSemester()` to get the active `StudentSemester` corresponding to the active timetable.
* `TimeTable getActiveTimeTable()` to get the active `TimeTable`. +
This throws a `NoActiveStudentException` exception if  a `Student` is not already selected. +
Note that the active `TimeTable` is not stored directly, but with `activeSemester` as previously mentioned.

The following methods change which student or timetable is selected:

* `void activateStudent(Student student)` selects the `student` in the `Planner` +
This throws a `StudentNotFoundException` exception if the `student` is not in the `Planner`. +
Note that the student is considered the same as another student in the list if `Student#isSameStudent()` returns `true`.
This allows activation of a student after its timetable is changed.
* `void activateSemester(StudentSemester semester)` selects the timetable corresponding to `semester` as the active timetable. +
This throws a `NoActiveStudentException` exception if a `Student` is not already selected.
* `void activateValidStudent()` and `void activateValidSemester()` are similar, but may select any arbitrary valid student and timetable respectively.

The following methods replace values stored by the student list:

* `void setStudents(List<Student> students)` replaces the student list entirely. This does _not_ reset the active student or active timetable, which may become invalidated. +
Make sure to use `Planner#activateStudent(null)` if you wish to reset this too.
* `void replaceActiveStudent(Student student)` replaces the currently selected `Student` with the specified `student` in the student list.
* `void replaceActiveTimeTable(TimeTable timeTable)` replaces the currently selected `TimeTable` with the specified `timeTable` in the selected student's `TimeTableMap`.

Many further methods modify properties of the selected student and timetable. Some examples are:

* `void addExemptedModule(ModuleCode moduleCode)` which adds an exempted module with the given `moduleCode` to the active student.
* `void addSemesterTimeTable(StudentSemester studentSemester)` which adds a timetable to the selected student using the specified `studentSemester`.
* `void removeEnrollment(ModuleCode moduleCode)` which removes an enrollment with the given `moduleCode` from the selected timetable.

[WARNING]
Avoid storing references to, and avoid directly calling methods with mutate `Student` or `Planner` objects retrieved from `Planner` or `Model`, as `Student` is mutable. +
Consider using the methods of `Model` directly to interact with the Model instead.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Mutability of data stored in `Planner`
* *Alternative 1: (current choice)* `Planner` stores references to mutable `Student` objects which store mutable `TimeTable` objects. +
Mutation of `Student` objects is allowed, but only through getter/setter methods.
** Pros: Mutability of `Student` enables developers to directly modify a `Student` directly with its methods. This is very convenient and decouples the implementation of `Student` from the implementation of `Planner`. +
This also makes implementation of `Planner` significantly easier, especially due to the nesting of data structures.
** Cons: There are no guarantees of immutability, and operations which mutate a `Student` can affect the `Planner`. The `Planner` is unable to observe any changes made to the `Student` object stored.

* *Alternative 2:* `Planner` stores a list of immutable `Student` objects, which also store immutable `TimeTable` objects.
** Pros: Immutability of the `Student` objects is enforced. Accidental mutation of a stored `Student` using a reference is not possible without using methods of the `Planner`.
** Cons: Making modifications to a stored `Student` would require the instantiation of a new modified copy. +
All involved classes (`Planner`, `Student`, `TimeTableMap`, `TimeTable`, etc.) would have to implement methods to mutate the required fields.

[[Implementation-Student]]
=== Student Features
(Vincent wrote the section "Student Features" below)

The *Student Feature* allows users to manage multiple academic plans, add and remove enrollments, and check their degree progression and grades.
As described in *Student Model* (in <<Design-Model,*Model Component*>>), the `Student` stores information related to the timetables it has, which in turn stores the enrollments for each timetable. This section will focus on the management of `Student` using commands provided to the user.

As users may want to do multiple operations on the same student, the user can select one student as the 'active student'.
Many commands then operate on the 'active student'. Certain commands (such as `"student active"` and `"student remove"`) can cause the 'active student' to be deselected.  How this is stored is described in more detail in <<Implementation-PlannerModel,*Planner Model*>>.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `StudentAddCommand` works by showing interactions
within the `Model` component when
`Logic#execute("student add n/Alice major/CS")` is called.

//TODO: ADD DIAGRAM
.Sequence Diagram of `StudentAddCommand`
image::StudentAddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
NOTE: The lifeline for `StudentAddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
[NOTE]
For brevity, the `Student` that the `StudentAddCommand` was constructed with is denoted as `"s"`. +
The actual parsing (i.e. `PlannerParser` calling `StudentCommandParser` which calls `StudentAddCommandParser`) is omitted for clarity. +
For brevity, the parameter of `PlannerParser#parseCommand()` (which is just `"student add n/Alice major/CS"`) is also omitted.

[NOTE]
"Active student" and "selected student" are used interchangably to refer to the student the user has selected with the `"student active"` command.

==== Student Management

The user may add, remove, select and list students with the `"student add"`, `"student remove"`, `"student active"` and `"student list"` command strings, respectively.
These correspond to the `StudentAddCommand`, `StudentRemoveCommand`, `StudentActiveCommand` and `StudentListCommand` classes.

These sub-commands are parsed by the `Student*CommandParser` sub-command parsers, with the exception of `StudentListCommand` which is directly returned by `StudentCommandParser`.
Refer to <<Backend-SubCmd, Sub-Commands>> to see how `Student*CommandParser` are invoked by `StudentCommandParser`.

The sub-commands `"remove"` and `"active"` for the `"student"` command both require a unsigned positive integer `"INDEX"` in the command string.
No arguments are allowed because they will be interpreted as being part of the `"INDEX"` string. +
Similarly, the `"add"` sub-command allows exactly `"n/NAME major/MAJOR"` in its parameters. +
This can be explained by `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize()` only splitting arguments using the prefixes provided to it.
Therefore, the commands correctly reject prefixes not specified in the command usage text, although the error message can be confusing
since the user might expect that all prefixes are split before validation.

Then, `Student*Command` objects are created and returned by the `Student*CommandParser#parse()`.
* For the `"student add"` command, `StudentAddCommand` is constructed with a new `Student` object created from the `"NAME"` and `"MAJOR"` arguments provided.
* For the `"student remove"` and `"student active"` commands, the `Student*Command` is constructed with an `Index` object representing the `"INDEX"` argument provided.

===== Adding a Student

When the user enters the `"student add"` command, `StudentAddCommand#execute(Model model)` is executed. The following steps occur:

. Checks if the `student : Student` is present in the `Model` using `Model#hasStudent(Student)`.
.. If so, then a `CommandException` is thrown.
. Otherwise, Add the `student` to the `Model` using `Model#addStudent(Student)`.
. Generate success message and return a `CommandResult`.


===== Listing Students

When the user enters the `"student list"` command, `StudentListCommand#execute(Model model)` is executed. +
The list of students is obtained with `Model#getStudentList()`. The list of students is then formatted into a newline-separated, numbered list string,
which is used in the success message.

[NOTE]
This operation cannot fail in any valid `Planner` state.

===== Removing and Selecting a Student

When the user enters the `"student remove"` or the `"student active"` command, `Student*Command#execute(Model model)` (corresponding to the sub-command) is executed.
The following steps occur:

. The `Index` supplied to the `Student*Command` constructor is checked if it is in the bounds of the student list by comapring with `Model#getStudentList().size()`.
.. If not, a `CommandException` is thrown with the `Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX` text.
. The `Student` corresponding to the `Index` is retrieved using `Model#getStudentList().get(int)`.
* For a `StudentRemoveCommand`, `Model#removeStudent(Student)` is called to remove the student. +
By removing the reference to the `Student` in the list of students in `Planner`, all data related to the student is hence removed.
* For a `StudentRemoveCommand`, `Model#activateStudent(Student)` is called to select the student.

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1: (current choice)* `Student` is mutable.
** Pros: Very convenient for developers to change `Student` objects imperatively.
** Cons: If references of the `Student` object are retained and then mutated unintentionally, the `Student` object in the `Planner` will also be mutated. +
Hence, developers need to be careful about calling methods which mutate the `Student` object. This increases coupling between `Student` and `Planner`.

* *Alternative 2:* `Student` is immutable.
** Pros: Immutability is guaranteed. Accidental mutation of the `Planner` cannot occur with any stray references.
** Cons: Mutating nested data structures in the `Student` object (e.g. a single `Grade` of an `Enrollment` stored in a `TimeTable` of the `Student`) can be very messy.
To mutate such data, `Student` or the caller needs to know about the implementation details of all involved nested classes (e.g. `TimeTableMap`, `StudentSemester`, `TimeTable`, `Enrollment`, etc.),
which increase coupling significantly. +
An alternative is that `Model` and `Planner` implements all the required mutation methods, handling said dependencies. This increases implementation complexity massively.

* *Alternative 3:* `Student` is mutable, but only deep copies of `Student` are returned by `Model`.
** Pros:
*** Immutability of the `Student` objects in the `Planner` is preserved. Accidental mutation of a returned copy does not result in mutation of the original stored in `Planner`. +
Developers can use the mutation methods of `Student` directly without worrying of mutating `Planner` accidentally. +
*** The implementation is also less complex than full immutability.
** Cons:
*** The implementation of a deep copy must be handled carefully to prevent the same reference from being used anywhere in a copied class (and thus only providing a shallow copy). +
*** The usage of copies to mutate a `Student` in the `Planner` is also not as convenient, because the old copy must be swapped with a new one. +
This can become problematic in future operations where the user is allowed to change identity fields (those affecting `Student#isSameStudent()`), such as changing the name of the student.
Since the new student will have a different name from the original, a different method of identifying students modified will need to be used.

[[Implementation-Timetable]]
=== Timetable Features
(Vincent wrote the section "Timetable Features" below)

The *Timetable Feature* allows users to manage timetables across semesters.

[NOTE]
"Active timetable" and "selected timetable" are used interchangably to refer to the timetable the user has selected with the `"timetable active"` command.

==== Timetable Implementation

Each `Student` stores a `TimeTableMap` representing the timetables of the student. The `TimeTableMap` stores a key-value pair mapping a `StudentSemester` to a `TimeTable`.

For each `TimeTableMap`, the `StudentSemester` keys must be unique. Therefore, there should not be duplicate semester keys.
This corresponds to each semester in the `TimeTableMap` only having one timetable. +
Note that this does not preclude multiple equal (`TimeTable#equals()`) but not identical (`==`) `TimeTable` objects
from being associated to different `StudentSemester` objects. This happens whenever an empty timetable is added to two different semesters with the `"timetable add"` command.

[NOTE]
A `StudentSemester` stores a `SemesterYear` instead of a `Semester` directly. +
While storing the academic year (`acadYear`) is supported by `SemesterYear`, it is currently unused in the App's code.
Only `SemesterYear.sem` is used for storing the `Semester` represented.


==== Timetable Management

Using the `"timetable add"`, `"timetable remove"`, `"timetable list"` and `"timetable active"` commands, users can manage the timetables of `Student` objects in the `Planner`.

===== Listing Timetables

The `StudentSemester` objects corresponding to the student's timetables can be listed using the `"timetable list"` command string.
The `TimeTableCommandParser` directly creates a `TimeTableListCommand` object (a subclass of `TimeTableCommand`), and all preamble and arguments are ignored.

`TimeTableListCommand#execute(Model)` first checks if there is an active student with `Model#hasActiveStudent()`. If not, it throws a `CommandException` with text `Messages.MESSAGE_NO_STUDENT_ACTIVE`. +
Then it gets all `StudentSemester` keys the selected student has in its `TimeTableMap` using `Model#getStudentSemesters()`,
which returns the `StudentSemester` in chronological order (as defined in `StudentSemester#compareTo()`).
This ordering is more convenient to the user compared to the arbitrary ordering of internal to `TimeTableMap`.

This list is then passed to `StringUtil.wrapCollection(Collection)`, which formats the list of `StudentSemester` into a comma-separated string.
The string is also wrapped for better readability by the user.

===== Specifying Timetables in Add, Remove and Active Commands

The sub-commands `"add"`, `"remove"` and `"active"` for the `"timetable"` command all require the arguments `"year/YEAR sem/SEM"`,
which are the `DegreeYear` and `Semester` corresponding to the `StudentSemester` respectively.

Both arguments are mandatory.

* If both arguments are missing, a `ParseException` will be thrown with the `MESSAGE_USAGE` string of the corresponding `TimeTable*Command`. +
This provides instruction about the specific sub-command for the user.
* If any argument is missing, the `TimeTable*CommandParser` will throw a `ParseException`. +
Validation of `"YEAR"` and `"SEM"` also occur. If `"YEAR"` is not a valid degree year (unsigned integer from 1 to 6 inclusive),
or if `"SEM"` is not one of `"1", "2", "st1", "st2"`, then the sub-command parser will also throw a `ParseException`.

Once the command string is parsed, the `DegreeYear` and `Semester` will be used to create a `StudentSemester`, which is passed to the constructor of `TimeTable*Command`.

===== Adding, Removing and Selecting a Timetable

The `TimeTable*Command` classes then receive a `StudentSemester` in its constructor parameter.

. All `TimeTable*Command#execute(Model)` methods first check that `Model#hasActiveStudent() : boolean` is `true`. This is needed because all these commands require an active student. +
Similar to `TimeTableListCommand` (documented above in *Listing Timetables*), if there is no active student, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
. Further checks may occur for different timetable sub-commands:

* `TimeTableAddCommand` checks if there is no matching semester (with `Model#hasSemester()`), then adds the timetable with `Model#addSemesterTimeTable()`
* `TimeTableRemoveCommand` checks if there is a matching semester (with `Model#hasSemester()`), then removes the timetable with `Model#removeSemesterTimeTable()` +
By removing the reference to the `TimeTable` in the `TimeTableMap` of the selected `Student`, all data related to the timetable is hence removed.
* `TimeTableActiveCommand` checks if there is a matching semester (with `Model#hasSemester()`), then sets the timetable as active with `Model#activateSemester()`

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of different timetables across semesters

* *Alternative 1: (current choice)* `TimeTableMap` is a `Map<StudentSemester, TimeTable>`
** Pros: Enforces uniqueness of a `TimeTable` value in the `TimeTableMap`, as explained <<Implementation-Timetable,earlier>>.
** Cons:
*** Serialisation of the `TimeTableMap` is more complex, requiring conversion to `JsonAdaptedTimeTableMap`, which is a list of `JsonAdaptedTimeTablePair`.
Deserialisation of `Map<K,V>` cannot happen automatically for custom classes `K` due to some limitations of Jackson. +
*** Ordering of timetables in `TimeTableMap.entrySet()` is arbitrary, which may be inconvenient for users.

* *Alternative 2:* `TimeTableMap` is a `List` of `Pair<StudentSemester, TimeTable>`
** Pros:
*** Serialisation of `TimeTableMap` is straightforward. +
*** Ordering of `StudentSemester` can easily be enforced by sorting the `TimeTableMap` by `StudentSemester` after every operation.
** Cons: Uniqueness constraint will have to be enforced by ensuring that insertions and deletions with a given `StudentSemester` key do not cause duplicate `StudentSemester` objects.

== Backend & Debugging

[[Backend-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::backend-json[]
[[Backend-JSON]]
=== JSON Handling & Module Data Management

As mentioned in several sections (of <<Implementation>>) above, NUS Module Planner has the capability to pull live data for entities, such as, `Major` and `Module`, via *JSON*.

*JSON* stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_ and is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. We choose this syntax as it is "self-describing" and thus, human-readable and easy to understand, while keeping our application size low.

*Jackson* is a standard JSON library for Java that contains a suite of data-processing tools, including JSON parsers and generators. Jackson is used for the JSON-related operations mentioned below.

The original schema of the JSON file came from NUSMods via version 2 of their API available link:http://nusmods.com/api/v2[here]. The endpoints we used are:

* `/{acadYear}/moduleInfo.json`
* `/{acadYear}/modules/{moduleCode}.json`

The Academic Year (`acadYear`) used is: `2019/2020`.

From the JSON responses of the above API endpoints, we created several classes to help convert the JSON representation of the object into a working *Java Object* that the application can use, as well as the other direction which is used to stored the current state of the `Planner` in a JSON file.

Such classes include:

* `JsonSerializableLesson`
* `JsonSerializableModule`
* `JsonSerializablePlanner`
* `JsonSerializableSemesterData`

The `ModuleDataImporterUtil` is used to parse the raw JSON files containing `Module` information and convert them into `JsonSerializableModule` objects which contain various attributes such as a list of `JsonSerializableSemesterData`.

.Sequence Diagram for a `run` operation in `ModuleDataImporterUtil`
image::sequenceDiagramModuleDataImporterUtil.png[align="center"]

The `LessonDataImporter` is used to parse the raw JSON files containing `Module`-specific Lesson information and convert them into `JsonSerializableModule` objects which contain various attributes such as a list of `JsonSerializableLesson`.

.Sequence Diagram for a `run` operation in `LessonDataImporter`
image::sequenceDiagramLessonDataImporterUtil.png[align="center"]

The following classes are used to convert objects of various classes (such as Module, Lesson, Student) into Jackson-friendly versions.

* `JsonAdaptedEnrollment`
* `JsonAdaptedGrade`
* `JsonAdaptedLesson`
* `JsonAdaptedModule`
* `JsonAdaptedModuleCode`
* `JsonAdaptedSemesterData`
* `JsonAdaptedSemesterYear`
* `JsonAdaptedStudent`
* `JsonAdaptedStudentSemester`
* `JsonAdaptedTimeTable`
* `JsonAdaptedTimeTableMap`
* `JsonAdaptedTimeTablePair`

When saving the `Planner`, `JsonSerializablePlanner` is used to store all the various attributes of the `Planner` in a JSON-compatible format, such as list of `Student` objects, currently active `Student` index, and currently active `SemesterYear`.

// end::backend-json[]

// tag::logging[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Backend-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// end::logging[]

[[Backend-SubCmd]]
=== Sub-Commands
(Vincent wrote the section "Sub-Commands" below)

Central to the command syntax of the App is the organisation of commands into sub-commands.
Commands such as `"student"` show the relevant instructions for how to use its sub-commands, such as `"student add"`.
This organisation of commands into a hierarchy improves usability by the user, and the organisation of the command implementations into packages.

Many commands of the App are organized into 'parent commands', such as `"student"`.
Its sub-commands are known as 'child commands' (e.g. `"student add"`). +
'Parent commands' must have a corresponding `Parser` and a `Command`. +
For example,
the corresponding `Parser` subclasses for the `"student"` command and its sub-commands are in the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/parser/student[`parser.student`] package,
while the `Command` subclasses are in the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/commands/student[`commands.student`] package.

Note that for a sub-command (e.g. `"student add"`), the 'parent command' parser only parses the command word for the 'parent command' (e.g. `"student"`), while the 'child command' only parses the command word for its sub-command (e.g. `"add"`).

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between the `*Command` and `*CommandParser` classes of 'parent commands' and 'child commands' when a command string is parsed. +
The 'parent command' is denoted as `"X"`, while the 'child command' is denoted as `"Y"`. The corresponding `Command` and `Parser` classes have been named accordingly.

//TODO: ADD DIAGRAM
.Sequence Diagram of Parent and Child Commands
image::SubCommandSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `XCommandParser` and `XYCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Parent and child command classes

The 'parent command' class (e.g. `StudentCommand`) should be declared `abstract`, and directly extend the `Command` class.
All sub-command classes should then extend the 'parent command' class (e.g. `StudentAddCommand` extends `StudentCommand`).

Similar to non-hierarchical commands, 'parent command' classes may contain the fields `COMMAND_WORD` and `MESSAGE_USAGE`
for use in the corresponding 'parent command' parsers. This decouples the message details of the command from the parsing of the commands.


==== Parent command parser class
'Parent command' parsers are required to dispatch parsing to a sub-command. This is somewhat similar to the main `PlannerParser`.
However, the splitting of the sub-command string into the sub-command name and its arguments
is handled by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/parser/SubCommandSplitter.java[`SubCommandSplitter.java`].
This utility class handles some edge cases related to whitespace, and is preferred when implementing a 'parent command'. +

The `Parser` for the 'parent command' (e.g. `StudentCommandParser`) should implement the `Parser<T>` interface,
where `T` is the class of the 'parent command' (e.g. `StudentCommand`). +

NOTE: This is different from child `Command` classes, which should extend their parent `Command` class

To split the sub-command string into the sub-command and arguments, use:

* `SubCommandSplitter(String userInput, String failureMessage)` to construct the `SubCommandSplitter` object
* `SubCommandSplitter#getCommand()` to get the command string
* `SubCommandSplitter#getSubCommand()` to get the arguments. +
Note that it is possible to create a more deeply nested hierarchy of commands subclassing the `Command` subclass appropriately.

Parsing of a hierarchical command string (e.g.`"student add n/Alice major/CS"`) happens in the following manner:

. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/parser/PlannerParser.java[`PlannerParser`]
removes `student` from the command string. A leading space followed by `"add n/Alice major/CS"` is passed to `StudentCommandParser`.
. `StudentCommandParser` invokes methods in `SubCommandSplitter` which parses the remaining command string
into the `"add"` command word and `"n/Alice major/CS"` as the arguments.
. `StuentCommandParser` matches the `"add"` string and creates a new `StudentAddCommandParser` with the input string `"n/Alice major/CS"`.
. `StudentAddCommandParser` can now parse the given preamble and arguments using
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/parser/ArgumentTokenizer.java[`ArgumentTokenizer`]

==== Child command parser class
'Child command' parsers should implement `Parser<T>`, where `T` is the 'child command' class. +
'Child command' parsers are responsible for parsing the preamble and arguments of the input.

It is not always necessary to create a parser for a 'child command'.
If the 'child command' may ignore any given preamble or arguments provided by the user,
the 'parent command' parser may simply return an instance of the 'child command' directly. +

For example, `StudentCommandParser` directly returns a `StudentListCommand` given the `"list"` command word.

== Proposed Future Enhancements

NUS Module Planner has a lot more potential to grow!

Below are some of the other great features we think can be implemented in v2.0 onward:

* *Module Viewer with Search* - Other than just searching for modules, search for their content instead, such as modules that deal with _Heat Transfer_ or _Geology_.
* *Timetable Planner with Friends* - Instead of just viewing timetables of different students (_i.e. friends_) separately, be able to overlay them in one _"Timetable View"_, for easier group planning.
* *Requirements Double-Upper* - Instead of just one `Major`, handle double `Major` programme students, or even those with Minors.
* *Module Popularity Prediction* - Get and analyse historic data from NUSMods about module uptake, so that students do not have to plan for modules that would be overly subscribed.
* *Support for Overseas Exchange and University Town College Programmes* - Be able to plan for special modules only offered in these programmes, if a student is enrolled in them.
* *Live Module Data* - Get the latest Module Data available from NUS Mods and plan your Semester before it starts.
* *Module Data History* - View historical data on Module enrollments and decide if when you want to take a certain `Module`.
